# Basic_Line_Follower_Robot
This project is a Line Follower Robot designed for navigating predefined paths autonomously. Using infrared sensors, the robot detects and follows a visible line on the ground. The code, compatible with microcontroller platform such as Arduino, implements a basic line-following algorithm.
